# **Simple Command-Line To-Do List App**

This is a basic console-to-do list manager implemented in Python. It provides users with the ability to add, delete, and list tasks. The app stores all tasks in a local text file, so your list will remain available even when the program has been terminated.

## **Features**

* **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are stored in todo.txt and retrieved every time the app is launched.  
* **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your to-do list.  
* **Remove Tasks:** Delete completed or unwanted tasks by their number.  
* **View Tasks:** Display your current list of tasks with clear numbering.
